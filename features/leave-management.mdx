The Leave Management feature in Birdie simplifies the process of tracking, managing, and planning leave schedules for your team. 

Here's how it works:

#### **Accessing the Leave Management Section**

Navigate to the **Leaves** option in the main menu to access the Leave Overview page. This page serves as the central hub for all leave-related actions.

### **Key Features and Actions**

1. **Leave Overview: Stay Informed**

   * **Who’s Off Today:** Instantly see which team members are unavailable today.

   * **Upcoming Leaves:** Plan ahead with a 7-day preview of scheduled leaves.

2. **Request Leave: A Simple Process** Employees can request leave by providing the following details:

   * **Leave Type:** Select from available leave options (e.g., PTO, sick day, etc.).

   * **Duration:** Choose between full-day, half-day (morning/afternoon), or custom durations.

   * **Dates and Reason:** Specify leave dates and provide a reason (if required).

   * Once submitted, requests are forwarded to the appropriate manager or admin for approval.

3. **Organization Leaves: Insights for Admins**

   * **View All Leaves:** Admins can view leave schedules across the organization.

   * **Filter Options:** Sort leaves by:

     * **Status** (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

     * **Department**

     * **Date Range**

   * **Export Leaves:** Generate a CSV report of filtered leave data instantly. **(Important Note:** During beta, exports are limited to 100 rows per fil&#x65;**.)**

4. **Pending Organization Leaves**

   * **Admins:** See and manage all pending leave requests across the organization.

5. **Pending Departments Leaves**

   * **Managers:** View and manage pending leave requests specifically for your department.
